# Cook Wilson on perception

Cook Wilson's discussion of realism focused primarily on knowledge. Indeed, Cook Wilson never published on perception. The main source of his views on perception is a letter he wrote responding to Stout's "Primary and Secondary Qualities". However, to bring out some of the connections between his realist conception of knowledge and his views about perception, it is useful to begin with a letter of 6 January 1904 to Prichard.

There Cook Wilson discusses two variants of a fundamental fallacy concerning knowledge or apprehension.

The first variant is the idealist attempt to understand knowledge as an activity. If knowledge is an activity, then in knowing something a subject must *do* something to the object known. But this, Cook Wilson claims, is absurd. The object of knowledge must be independent of the subject's knowing it, if coming to know is to be a discovery: 

>You can no more act upon the object by knowing it than you can 'please the Dean and Chapter by stroking to dome of St. Paul's'. THe man who first discovered the equable curvature meant equidistance from a point didn't supposed that he 'produced' the truth---that absolutely contradicts the idea of truth---nor that he changed the nature of the circle or curvature, or of the straight line, or of anything spatial.

The second variant is the representative realist's attempt to understand knowledge and apprehension in terms representation. Whereas the idealist attempts to explain apprehension in terms of apprehending, the representative realist attempts to explain apprehension in terms of the object apprehended, in the present instance, an idea or some other representation. The problem is that this merely pushes the problem back a level:

> The chief fallacy of this is not so much the impossibility of knowing such image is like the object, or that there is any object at al, but that it assumes the very thing it is intended to explain. The image itself has till to be *apprehended* and the difficulty is only repeated.

In what sense are the fallacies of explaining apprehension in terms of apprehending and in terms of the object of apprehension variants of the same fallacy? The are variants of the same fallacy in that both attempt to *explain* knowledge or apprehension:

> Perhaps most fallacies in the theory of knowledge are reduced to the primary one of trying to *explain* the nature of knowledge or apprehending. We cannot *construct knowing*---the act of apprehending---out of any elements. I remember quite early in my philosophic reflection having an instinctive aversion to the very expression '*theory* of knowledge'. I felt the words themselves suggested a fallacy---an utterly fallacious inquiry, though I was not anxious to proclaim <it>.

This is a clear statement of the disjunctivism or anti-hybridism about knowledge that McDowell and Williamson later will defend. Also, Cook Wilson's skepticism about the "theory of knowledge" will be echoed by Prichard, Ryle, and Austin and in precisely these terms.

Is Cook Wilson a disjunctivist about perception as well? The matter is unclear. In his letter to Stout he does defend a conception of perception as the direct apprehension of objects spatially external to the perceiving subject, and in the letter to Prichard he does at one point speak indifferently of knowledge, apprehension, and *perception*. Neither consideration is decisive. More telling, however, is that the fallacies of explaining apprehension in terms of the object apprehended and in terms of the apprehending of the object are echoed in the letter to Stout and, indeed, form the core of its content (though there is much that is of interest besides---the letter to Stout is a particularly rich discussion with lots of detailed argumentation). In particular, both representative realist and idealist accounts of perception are criticized in line with the two variant fallacies concerning knowledge or apprehension.

## Representative Realism

Cook Wilson singles out for criticism Stout's claim that the sensations which mediate knowledge of secondary qualities do so only in so far as "they represent, express, or stand for something other than themselves".

Perhaps, the most fundamental issue consists in negative and positive claims about the nature of representation. The negative claim is that nothing is intrinsically representational:

> Nothing has *meaning* in itself. 

Presumably this was an effective point against those of his contemporaries who held that ideas are intrinsically representational. The positive claim is put as follows: 

> Representation is our subjective act. ... It is *we* who mean. 

It is on these grounds that Cook Wilson criticizes Bradley's theory of judgment (*Statement and Inference*, XIII, §§124-125). This thought, or something very much like it, independently animates McDowell in his discussion of Dennett, and Travis in his discussion of the representational theory of experience. While this is really the fundamental point, Cook Wilson doesn't explicitly argue for it, either in the present letter or in the manuscript about Bradley's theory of judgement. Perhaps the thought is that in the absence of anything being intrinsically representational, the only fact that could make for representation essentially involves a subject.

There are weaker and stronger ways to understand the positive claim:

* Perhaps representation is personal in the sense that it belongs to a conscious subject.
* Perhaps representation is personal in the sense that its the result of something a person does.

The distinction potentially bears on whether Cook Wilson's criticism generalizes to encompass, not only representative realism, but the representational theory of experience (understood *not* as an explanatory hypothesis about the phenomenal character of experience of the kind that Harman endorses, but merely as the attribution to experience of representational content.) Perhaps, a conception of representation as something a subject does, if developed and sustained, would count against the representational theory of experience (but see McDowell's remarks about spontaneity); but it is unobvious that a conception of representation as merely belonging to a subject would. Experiences are, after all, states of a subject (contrast subpersonal states of a subject such as neurophysiological states). However, Cook Wilson's favored slogan, "It is we who mean", favors the stronger interpretation

On the basis of the personal conception of representation in hand, Cook Wilson makes a number of criticisms of representative realism. Let's consider two. 

Cook Wilson draws a distinction between two different natural relations that ground different notions of representation:

1. A may represent B because A *resembles* B
2. A may represent B because the existence of A *necessarily covaries* with B

These are not two analyses of different notions of representation since this would result in an impersonal conception of representation. Mimesis and necessary covariation are merely natural relations that *incline* us to represent things by means of them---they are merely relations that can be exploited by a subject's representational ends:

> It is we who make the weeping willow a symbol of sorrow. There may of course be something in the object which prompts us to give it a meaning, e.g., the resemblance of the weeping willow to a human figure bowed over in the attitude of grief. But the willow in itself can neither 'mean' grief, nor 'represent' nor 'stand for' nor 'express' grief. *We* do all that. (*Statement and Inference*, 770)

First, Cook Wilson emphasizes the symmetry of these relations. If A resembles B in some respect, B resembles A in that respect. If A necessarily covaries with B, B necessarily covaries with A. This undermines the asymmetry between Stout's talk of a sense-representation and what it represents. Or rather, if that asymmetry is sustained, this is evidence of a further assumption in play. Specifically, if A represents B without B representing A this is because A but not B is "present to consciousness". To bring to light how the personal conception of representation is at work here consider the following. Suppose that Stout is working with an impersonal notion of representation (though he shouldn't, at least by Cook Wilson's lights). If Stout is working with an impersonal notion of representation then the the external world could (impersonally) represent the sensation, it is just not a relation that anyone could exploit.

Second, if we consider sensations as representative this must be so either on the grounds of likeness or covariation with extension. We must already be acquainted with the likeness or know the covariation. But this is impossible if the mediation of our knowledge of extension by sensation means that we depend on such sensations for our knowledge of extension. How plausible is the operative epistemological premise? Advocates of certain forms of naturalized semantics, such as Fodor's correlational psychosemantics, would deny any such epistemic assumption. So would reliabilists like Goldman who maintain that what confers justification on belief is that it is formed by a reliable belief forming mechanism, not that we know that it is so formed. Are they justified in doing so? What does this tell us about Cook Wilson's argument? I suspect that here too, the personal conception of representation is at work, at least implicitly. The hypothesis is that the restriction that we should know of the relevant natural relations flows form the thought that it is only if we know of such relations that we could exploit them for our representational ends.

How does Cook Wilson's criticism of representative realism in terms of the personal conception of representation relate to the "fallacy" described in the letter to Prichard? The weeping willow resembles a human figure bowed over in the attitude of grief. This presents a subject with an opportunity to exploit that resemblance for their own representational ends, at least if they are apprised of that resemblance. In using the willow to represent grief, the subject apprehends the content of that representation. And that, according to Cook Wilson, is precisely what prevents representation from figuring in an explanation of perceptual apprehension. Any such explanation would be circular and,hence, no explanation at all.
