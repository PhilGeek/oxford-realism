# Cook Wilson on perception

Cook Wilson's discussion of realism focused primarily on knowledge. Indeed, Cook Wilson never published on perception. The main source of his views on perception is a letter he wrote responding to Stout's "Primary and Secondary Qualities". However, to bring out some of the connections between his realist conception of knowledge and his views about perception, it is useful to begin with a letter of 6 January 1904 to Prichard.

There Cook Wilson discusses two variants of a fundamental fallacy concerning knowledge or apprehension.

The first variant is the idealist attempt to understand knowledge as an activity. If knowledge is an activity, then in knowing something a subject must *do* something to the object known. But this, Cook Wilson claims, is absurd. The object of knowledge must be independent of the subject's knowing it, if coming to know is to be a discovery: 

>You can no more act upon the object by knowing it than you can 'please the Dean and Chapter by stroking to dome of St. Paul's'. THe man who first discovered the equable curvature meant equidistance from a point didn't supposed that he 'produced' the truth---that absolutely contradicts the idea of truth---nor that he changed the nature of the circle or curvature, or of the straight line, or of anything spatial.

The second variant is the representative realist's attempt to understand knowledge and apprehension in terms representation. Whereas the idealist attempts to explain apprehension in terms of apprehending, the representative realist attempts to explain apprehension in terms of the object apprehended, in the present instance, an idea or some other representation. The problem is that this merely pushes the problem back a level:

> The chief fallacy of this is not so much the impossibility of knowing such image is like the object, or that there is any object at al, but that it assumes the very thing it is intended to explain. The image itself has till to be *apprehended* and the difficulty is only repeated.

In what sense are the fallacies of explaining apprehension in terms of apprehending and in terms of the object of apprehension variants of the same fallacy? The are variants of the same fallacy in that both attempt to *explain* knowledge or apprehension:

> Perhaps most fallacies in the theory of knowledge are reduced to the primary one of trying to *explain* the nature of knowledge or apprehending. We cannot *construct knowing*---the act of apprehending---out of any elements. I remember quite early in my philosophic reflection having an instinctive aversion to the very expression '*theory* of knowledge'. I felt the words themselves suggested a fallacy---an utterly fallacious inquiry, though I was not anxious to proclaim <it>.

This is a clear statement of the disjunctivism or anti-hybridism about knowledge that McDowell and Williamson later will defend. Also, Cook Wilson's skepticism about the "theory of knowledge" will be echoed by Prichard, Ryle, Austin, and later, Williamson.

Is Cook Wilson a disjunctivist about perception as well? The matter is unclear. In his letter to Stout he does defend a conception of perception as the direct apprehension of objects spatially external to the perceiving subject, and in the letter to Prichard he does at one point speak indifferently of knowledge, apprehension, and *perception*. Neither consideration is decisive. More telling, however, is that the fallacies of explaining apprehension in terms of the object apprehended and in terms of the apprehending of the object are echoed in the letter to Stout and, indeed, form the core of its content (though there is much that is of interest besides---the letter to Stout is a particularly rich discussion with lots of detailed argumentation).
